Shallow Water Equations in Python

### Barotropic Vorticity
A spectral code for solving the Barotropic vorticity equation

D/Dt[ω] = 0

where ω = ξ + f.  ξ is local vorticity ∇ × u and f = f0 + βy is global rotation using the beta-plane approximation.

### Würsch & Craig
A one-dimensional shallow water model with simple convection parameterisation.
This is based on the data assimilation model published by Würsch & Craig in [[wursch2014]]
